    "The MNIST dataset is a collection of handwritten digit images that has been modified from two datasets originally collected by the National Institute of Standards and Technology in the United States.\n",
    "\n",
    "It is a popular dataset and can be easily loaded in a Google Colab notebook using the provided code snippet:\n",
    "```python\n",
    "from keras.datasets import mnist\n",
    "(X_train, y_train), (X_test, y_test) = mnist.load_data()\n",
    "```\n",
    "The dataset contains every digit from 0 to 9.\n",
    "\n",

    "+ The digit 1 has the most images in the dataset, totaling 7,877 images.\n",

    "+ The digit 0 has the least images in the test set, totaling 600 images.\n",
    "\n",

    "## Official Solution\n",
    "We need to write some code to answer this question. Let's start by concatenating the train and test sets:\n",
    "```python\n",
    "import numpy as np\n",
    "labels = np.concatenate((y_train, y_test))\n",
    "```\n",
    "Notice that we don't need to worry about `X_train` and `X_test` because those arrays contain the images. We can answer the question by looking at the labels only.\n",
    "\n",
    "Numpy's unique() function will allow us to group and count the labels:\n",
    "```python\n",
    "digit, count = np.unique(labels, return_counts=1)\n",
    "```\n",
    "If we print the count corresponding to digit 1, we will find out that there are 7,877 images:\n",
    "```python\n",
    "print(count[1])\n",
    "```\n",
    "To determine how popular each digit is, we can print the entire count array and get the following result: [6903, 7877, 6990, 7141, 6824, 6313, 6876, 7293, 6825, 6958]. Notice that digit 1 is indeed the most popular in the dataset.\n",
    "\n",
    "We can check how many instances of digit 0 in the test set with the following code that will print 980:\n",
    "```python\n",
    "print(np.where(y_test == 0)[0].shape[0])\n",
    "```\n",
    "We can find the total number of images on each set by printing `y_train.shape[0]` and `y_test.shape[0]`. The result will be 60,000 and 10,000, respectively.\n",
    "\n",
    "Finally, we can check how many instances of digit 3 in the train set with the following code that will print 6,131:\n",
    "```python\n",
    "print(np.where(y_train == 3)[0].shape[0])\n",
    "```"
